**vehicle-audio-damage-detector** is a machine learning-powered web application that detects automobile damage based on sound analysis. By uploading or recording car sounds, the app identifies the type of mechanical issue and suggests both temporary and permanent solutions.

---

## 🎯 Features

- 🎙️ Upload or record vehicle sound
- 🔍 Detects 6 damage types:
  - `engine_knock`
  - `brake_squeal`
  - `transmission_grinding`
  - `exhaust_leak`
  - `belt_squeal`
  - `normal_operation`
- 🧠 ML/Deep Learning model for real-time prediction
- 💡 Recommends temporary and permanent fixes
- 📦 MongoDB database stores analysis history
- 🛠 Robust error handling for invalid files

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **ML Model**: Pretrained sound classification model (or custom)
- **Frontend**: HTML + JS (optional)
- **Database**: MongoDB (via `pymongo`)
- **Hosting**: Can be deployed using Render, Railway, or locally
